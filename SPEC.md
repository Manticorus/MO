# SPEC

## MVP Constraint

No adjacency, assume every city reachable; all attacks are legal; allies always come on defense.

## Scope for M0

This stage is limited to solution and project scaffolding only:
- `src/Mo3.Engine` for core domain engine code.
- `src/Mo3.App` for the WPF client app.
- `tests/Mo3.Tests` for test scaffolding.

No gameplay, resolver, map/adjacency, dominion/enclave, or city-connectivity logic is implemented in M0.
